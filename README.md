**Tired of your Samsung budget phone lagging like it's stuck in 2012?** 

This GitHub Actions workflow is your ticket to reviving devices like the **Galaxy A04s, A05, A05s, A06, A15, A16**—and any Samsung device with a `super` partition and Project Treble support. 

We replace the bloated, heavy OneUI system with a lightweight custom ROM by rebuilding your `super.img` directly in the cloud. **No Linux install required. No terminal sorcery. Just raw performance.**

---

## 🛠️ The Problem: Why This Exists

### 1. The "Super" Headache
Google introduced the `super` partition—a dynamic container that crams `system`, `vendor`, `product`, and `system_ext` into one single block. It’s great for OTAs, but **hell for modders**. 

### 2. The TWRP Ghost
Most budget Samsungs don't have official TWRP builds. Without TWRP, flashing a GSI (Generic System Image) usually requires a Linux machine and complex `lpmake` commands. 

**This repo automates the entire process using GitHub's servers.**

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Pre-configured Support**: One-click builds for **Galaxy A04s (64GB)** and **Galaxy A15** (no firmware links needed!).
- ✅ **EROFS & EXT4 Support**: Now officially supports the latest EROFS filesystems.
- ✅ **Cloud Powered**: Runs 100% on GitHub Actions—save your own CPU and RAM.
- ✅ **Universal Input**: Accepts `.img`, `.img.xz`, `.img.gz`, or `.zip`.
- ✅ **Smart Caching**: Stock firmware is cached to make subsequent builds lightning fast.
- ✅ **Branded & Optimized**: Automatically adds `Built.By.Minh2077.Script` to your `build.prop`.

## ✅ How to Use (3-Step Speedrun)

### 1. Setup
*   **Fork** this repository to your own account.
*   Navigate to the **Actions** tab and enable them.

### 2. Configure & Run
Choose the **"Android Super Repack (Universal FS)"** workflow and hit **Run Workflow**:

| Input | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Device Preset** | Select A04s or A15 to skip the firmware URL step. |
| **Stock Firmware URL** | Direct link to your `AP_*.tar.md5` (Skip if using presets). |
| **Custom System URL** | Link to your GSI (.img, .xz, .zip). *Must match or exceed Stock Android version.* |
| **Options** | Toggle **Empty Product**, **Writable Partitions**, or **Silent Mode**. |

### 3. Flash
1.  Wait 10–20 mins.
2.  Download the repacked `.tar` from the **Releases** or **Artifacts** section.
3.  **Odin:** Put the `.tar` in the **AP** slot.
4.  **Format Data:** This is mandatory. Boot to recovery (Vol Up + Power while plugged into USB) and **Wipe Data/Factory Reset**.

## 🖼️ How to Get Firmware Links
Don't know where to get the `AP` link? Follow the visual guide in the `pic/` folder:
`pic1.png` through `pic14.png` provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the extraction process.

---

## 🧙 How the Magic Works
1.  **Decomposition**: The workflow pulls your stock firmware and extracts the original `super.img`.
2.  **Space Management**: GitHub Runners are small. The script aggressively purges unnecessary packages to make room for the massive Samsung images.
3.  **Injection**: Your custom GSI is injected into the super-container, replacing the bloated OneUI system partition.
4.  **Compression**: The tool repacks the image into an Odin-flashable `.tar` or a raw `.img` for Heimdall.

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

*   **"No space left on device"**: GitHub runners have ~14GB of usable space. If your firmware is massive, the build might fail. 
*   **Bootloops**: Ensure you formatted data in recovery. Also, verify your ROM is the correct architecture (usually `arm64-ab`).
*   **Odin Errors**: Ensure you are using the latest version of Odin and your Samsung drivers are up to date.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
> **I am not responsible for bricked devices.** If you ignore the warnings, flash the wrong architecture, or ignore the "Format Data" step, your phone will become a very expensive paperweight.
